# Building_Evacuation_Optimization
Used Linear programming to construct an optimal evacuation plan for Dante Hall, A residence hall at SUNY Geneseo.

We used linear programming optimization routines in excel to solve this problem. For more information on how we constructed our evacuation model, please see, Allen-Barcomb-Ramsey-Evacuation_Planning_Dante.pdf
